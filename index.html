    <h3 id="tribute-info">Here is a timeline of Steven Gerrards club football career:</h3>
    <p><span class="bold">1989</span> - Gerrard was discovered by his local upper-division football club, Liverpool FC, at age nine.</p>
<p><span class="bold">1998</span> - Made his first team debut against Blackburn Rovers as a substitute, and he became a regular contributor the following year.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2000/2001</span> - Gerrard had established himself as a star midfielder, Liverpool went on to win the League Cup, FA Cup, and UEFA Cup that season. Gerrard also earned England’s Young Player of the Year honours.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2003</span> - Gerrard was named Liverpool's captain at just 23 years of age.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2004/2005</span> - Led Liverpool to the club’s first Champions League title in 21 years, scoring a key goal in Liverpool’s dramatic three-goal comeback against AC Milan in the final.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2005</span> - During the following off-season he became embroiled in a high-profile contract dispute with Liverpool that nearly resulted in his transfer to Chelsea FC before he ultimately re-signed with his longtime club.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2005/2006</span> - Gerrard then helped Liverpool win both the FA Cup and UEFA Super Cup. He was named the Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year at season’s end.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2007</span> - Liverpool advanced to the Champions League final for the second time in three years but lost to AC Milan by a score of 2–1.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2008/2009</span> - Gerrard scored a career-high 24 goals in the 2008–09 Premier League season, which netted him the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year award.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2009/2012</span> - Gerrard and Liverpool then ran off a string of four consecutive season finishes outside the top five Premier League positions. One bright spot during that stretch was the team’s performance in the nonleague tournaments during the 2011–12 season, when Liverpool won the League Cup and were the runners-up in the FA Cup.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2013/2014</span> - The club broke back through this season, leading the Premier League for six of the final seven weeks of the season only to relinquish the championship in the final week to place second in the league.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2014/2015</span> - Gerrard played one more season with Liverpool, leaving the team having scored 186 career goals for the club, fifth most in Liverpool history.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2015/2016</span> - He then joined the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS). Gerrard played with the Galaxy for two seasons before retiring from club football in 2016.</p>

<h4>Steven Gerrard is known as one of the best midfielders of his generation and certainly deserved more honours from his club career. Staying loyal to his boyhood club and captaining below-par Liverpool squads meant he was unable to win more trophies. This  though is why many LFC fans see him as the greatest player to wear the shirt. They wouldn't of won what they did without him. His passion, leadership and technical ability was matched by very few in football. </h4>
